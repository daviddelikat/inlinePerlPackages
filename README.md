inlinePerlPackages
==================

Here is where I keep handy perl packages that I use inline while developing scripts

Note:  These are not modules, they are not intended to be 'use'd in perl packages
they are building blocks that can be dropped into a script when they are helpful.
They provide a fast simple object oriented interface to a feature that comes in
handy.

Let me know if you find these useful or if you see any improvements of any kind.
