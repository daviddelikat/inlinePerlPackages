can I create a module that will include code from here?

something like:

use InlinePerl <filename>;

it should eval the referenced code in the context of the calling module.

probably would change the module extensions to ipm or something else
that distinguishes them from the non-module items; or create a map
in the inlineperl module that helps it find the code it needs to include.
