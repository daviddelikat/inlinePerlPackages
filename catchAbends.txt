this END block catches ABEND's and runs git pull
so that a remote programmer can push code to the repository
and fix the problem without needing to log into the server.

the last line ensures that the ABEND is propigated
to the final exit

this code should be inserted as early as possible in the
module so that it will run for nearly any kind of failure
